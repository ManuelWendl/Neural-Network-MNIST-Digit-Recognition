# Neural-Network-MNIST-Digit-Recognition
This repository gives a good glance on how neuronal networks actually work behind the scenes. 

The task was to build a classifying algorithm in order to reccognize digits from the well known MNIST handwritten digit dataset. 
The algorithm is a basic supervised learning system, in form of a neural network with two hidden layers.
The size of the hidden layers can be changed in the code (Default settings: 200 and 60 neurons). 
The default activation function is the Sigmoid function. Detailed explanation also in the Jupyter file. 
The trainings and test dataset are strictly seperated and both downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/.
